# Embracing Dynamics: Dynamics-aware 4D Gaussian Splatting SLAM (D4DGS-SLAM)

# Note
- The code will be publicly released upon acceptance to IROS2025. Please stay tuned for this exciting work. Thank you for your attention.


## TODO list
- [ ] release the arxiv link
- [ ] release the code of the 4d-gaussian-rasterization for 4DGS-based SLAM
- [ ] release the full code of our D4DGS-SLAM
- [ ] release the code of the evaluation
